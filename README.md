## Welcome

Welcome and congratulations on joining the MDN HPCP Team! We are excited to have you as a part of this team and look forward to teaching some cool technologies and ideas to you. My name is Tyler Swann and I'll be the lead educator for this workshop series. During this series you will be learning the C++ programming language along with techniques for, computer memory, algorithm intuition and parallel computing techniques.

## About this Repository

This repository contains the information, resources and links to help guide you through this series. Each directory will have a corresponding `README.md` file which is displayed when viewing that directory on GitHub. These files will give a synopsis of everything to do with that directory. The weekly content can be found in the `content/` directory, which has been broken down by week.

Each week has directories for the tasks, examples and meetup slides for that week. Any other helpful information brought during meetups will be added to the `README.md` of each week. Read the information carefully and follow each step as listed. If you need help, don't hesitate to read out.

The links below can help direct you to the relevant pages.

## Weekly Meetups

Each week, the team will meet at Monash Clayton Campus (location, day, time etc. are TBD) were we will go through the content, tackle any issues and misunderstandings, experiment, discuss ideas and showcase things people have built.

It is expected that all team members show up for the meetups in person unless previously discussed with the management team. There will be online access and we have plans to record it for future reference but again, ideally everyone is present for the meetups.

Each Weeks `README.md` will contain the day, date, location and time of that weeks meetup however, it is expected to remain relatively consistent throughout the series. Any clashes will be dealt with in the meetup the week before and announced to all members.
