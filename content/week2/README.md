# Week 2

Ordering, Conditional Logic, Loops and Printing

## Overview

Over the last two weeks we have gone into quite considerable depth around C++'s type system. This week you will be exposed to the concept of ordering, equality and the logical operators in C++. You will also learn about conditional logic and how it can be used to create structure and control the flow of a program. You will also learn about C++ looping facilities and how it can be used to perform iterative programming. Finally, you will look a bit more in depth at C++'s IO facilities.
