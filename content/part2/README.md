# Part 2

Types, Variables, Qualifiers, Operators and Streams

## Overview

<!-- Fix!! -->

This week you will be introduced to C++ type system, how it differs from other languages and how types reflect machine architecture. You will also learn about variable declarations, type qualifiers and a few of the key operators in C++. You will also be exposed to the concept of streams and C++'s IO facilities. Just a forewarning, the is a reasonable amount of reading this week as we delve deeper into C++'s type system.

Over the last two weeks we have gone into quite considerable depth around C++'s type system. The focus of this week is a few of C++'s first-class abstractions facilities. You will be exposed to the concept of ordering, equality and the logical operators in C++. You will also learn about conditional logic and how it can be used to create structure and control the flow of a program. You will also learn about C++ looping facilities and how it can be used to perform iterative programming. Finally, you will learn the basics of functions in C++.
