# Week 0

Introduction to Shells, Terminals, Compilers and C++

## Overview

Welcome to Week 0 of MDN's High Performance Programming Workshop Series (HPP). This week you will hit the ground running and setup your device for developing with C++ by downloading the essential tools and software.

You will create your first C++ program, looking at various components and getting a basic understanding of how to compile and execute you code. You will also get access to unique tools to speed and ease development including learning the basics of version control with Git and GitHub.
