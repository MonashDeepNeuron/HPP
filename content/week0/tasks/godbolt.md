# Compiler Explorer

Compiler Explorer; sometimes referred to as Godbolt (after its creator Matthew Godbolt) is an online compiler for C++. It is good for testing and prototyping small code snippets from C++ across many different compiler versions, from different vendors and on different architectures.

It also displays the assembly output allowing you to have a closer look at what goes on under the hood in C++. It also allows sharing permalinks to instances of Godbolt with specific code and configuration running so you xan distribute working code to anyone as long as they got a browser.

## Task 7

### 7.1 Godbolt ⚡

Head on over to [Compiler Explorer](https://www.godbolt.org/) and copy the "Hello World" program, replacing the code in the editor with your "Hello World". It should automatically compile and build and display the results in one of the screens.

If this doesn't work, not to worry, we'll cover it in more detail in the meetup. if you want to see a running, shared godbolt program, click [here](https://www.godbolt.org/z/GKxzfees6).

## Final Words

Well done! You just finished your first week of High Performance Programming. I know it was pretty dull and tedious installing the all the software but now you are setup good and well to start learning the most powerful programming language.

All the best and see you at the meetup.
