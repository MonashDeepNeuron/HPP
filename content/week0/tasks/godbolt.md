# Compiler Explorer

Compiler Explorer; sometime referred to as Godbolt (after its creator Matthew Godbolt) is an online compiler for C++. It is good for testing and prototyping small code snippets from C++ across many different compiler versions, from different vendors and on different architectures. It also displays the assembly output allowing you to have a closer look at what goes on under the hood in C++.
