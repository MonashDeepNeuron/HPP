## What is Git

Git is a Software Control Management (SCM) tool. It keeps track of files current changes, keeps a history of files and has facilities to merge and distribute changes amongst contributors. Projects are managed in what is called a repository (repo). A repo is just a directory/folder that a software project lives. You are currently looking at a file in a repo.

## What is GitHub

GitHub is a website that hosts and helps manage remote/online repos. This makes it easier to collaborate and share repos as well as having many tools to automate project pipelines.

## Task 1

### 1.1 : Create a Github Account

To start off, create a GitHub account. Use a personal email as you are likely to use this throughout your career. Take note of your username and email as you will need it later.

### 1.2 : Get Access to MDN Organization

During this weeks meetup we will gather your usernames to give you direct access the the MDN GitHub organization. This will allow you to access the discussion channels and direct access to the repos within.
