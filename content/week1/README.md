# Week 1

Types, Data, Variables, Qualifiers and Operators

## Overview

This week you will be introduced to C++ type system, how it differs from other languages and how types reflect machine architecture. You will also learn about variable declarations, type qualifiers and a few of the key operators in C++. You will also get a bit more exposure to printing with `std::cout`.
