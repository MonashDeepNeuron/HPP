# Compiler Explorer

Compiler Explorer; sometimes referred to as Godbolt (after its creator Matthew Godbolt) is an online compiler for C++. It is good for testing and prototyping small code snippets from C++ across many different compiler versions, from different vendors and on different architectures.

It also displays the assembly output allowing you to have a closer look at what goes on under the hood in C++. It also allows sharing permalinks to instances of Godbolt with specific code and configuration running so you xan distribute working code to anyone as long as they got a browser.

## Godbolt âš¡

Head on over to [Compiler Explorer](https://www.godbolt.org/) and copy the "Hello World" program into the editor window. It should automatically compile, build and display the results in one of the screens. An example of a sharable link from Godbolt is [here](https://www.godbolt.org/z/GKxzfees6).
