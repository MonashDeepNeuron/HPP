# Git and GitHub

## Section 1

### 1.1 : Create a Github Account

To start off, create a GitHub account. Use a personal email as you are likely to use this throughout your career. Take note of your username and email as you will need it later.

### 1.2 : Get Access to MDN Organization

During this weeks meetup we will gather your usernames to give you direct access the the MDN GitHub organization. This will allow you to access the discussion channels and direct access to the repos within.
