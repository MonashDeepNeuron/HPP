# Threads Examples

Examples from Part 7 - [Threads](/content/part7/tasks/threads.md). You will have to build and compile on your own machine as Godbolt doesn't support linking with TBB or atomic.

## Build & Run

```sh
$ bpt build -t build.yaml -o build

# ...

./build/<thread | jthread | thread-pool>
```
