# High Performance Programming

Resources and challenges for the Monash DeepNeuron High Performance Programming Team.

## Welcome

Welcome and congratulations on joining the MDN HPP Team! We are excited to have you as a part of this team and look forward to teaching some cool technologies and ideas to you. My name is Tyler Swann and I'll be the lead educator for this workshop series. During this series you will be learning the C++ programming language along with techniques for, computer memory, algorithm intuition and parallel computing techniques.

## Weekly Meetups

Each week, the team will meet at Monash Clayton Campus (location, day, time etc. are TBD) were we will go through the content, tackle any issues and misunderstandings, experiment, discuss ideas and showcase things people have built.

It is expected that all team members show up for the meetups in person unless previously discussed with the management team. There will be online access and we have plans to record it for future reference but again, ideally everyone is present for the meetups.

Each week I will make an announcement containing any information regarding the weekly meetup. Meetup times and locations are expected to remain relatively consistent throughout the series. Any clashes will be dealt with in the meetup the week before and announced to all members.
