# High Performance Programming

_by Tyler Swann, in collaboration with Monash DeepNeuron_

## Welcome

Welcome to Monash DeepNeuron's _High Performance Programming (C++ edition)_, a book aimed at teaching techniques for developing programs that are both fast and safe. Throughout this book you will be learning the C++ programming language along with techniques for; computer memory, algorithm intuition, parallel computing and more.

## How to use this book

This book is designed to be read cover-to-cover. Concepts in later chapters will build upon concepts from previous chapters. On either side of the page there are arrow buttons that will move you between pages and chapters. You can also search for specific content using the search button in the top left or by pressing the <kbd>S</kbd> key.

<!-- ## Weekly Meetups

Each week, the team will meet at Monash Clayton Campus (location, day, time etc. are TBD) were we will go through the content, tackle any issues and misunderstandings, experiment, discuss ideas and showcase things people have built.

It is expected that all team members show up for the meetups in person unless previously discussed with the management team. There will be online access and we have plans to record it for future reference but again, ideally everyone is present for the meetups.

Each week I will make an announcement containing any information regarding the weekly meetup. Meetup times and locations are expected to remain relatively consistent throughout the series. Any clashes will be dealt with in the meetup the week before and announced to all members. -->
