# High Performance Programming

_by Tyler Swann, in collaboration with Monash DeepNeuron_

## Welcome

Welcome to Monash DeepNeuron's _High Performance Programming (C++ edition)_, a book aimed at teaching techniques for developing programs that are both fast and safe. Throughout this book you will be learning the C++ programming language along with techniques for; computer memory, algorithm intuition, parallel computing and more.

## How to use this book

This book is designed to be read cover-to-cover. Concepts in later chapters will build upon concepts from previous chapters. On either side of the page there are arrow buttons that will move you between pages and chapters. You can also search for specific content using the search button in the top left or by pressing the <kbd>S</kbd> key.
