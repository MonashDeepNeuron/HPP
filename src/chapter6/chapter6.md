# Algorithms & Data Structures

So far you have learnt a lot about the C++ language from user-defined types with classes, to generic programming with templates and concepts as well as (almost) all of the languages primitive types, control flow and looping mechanisms. With all of this you can pretty much get a computer to do anything. However, this is only the foundation; mind you all taught at once, what comes next is the fun chapter. We cover some the of facilities, techniques and practices focused on actually manipulating data and performing actual computation. Many of these facilities are available in the C++ standard library; after all this isn't C, we don't have to build everything from scratch. This will include everything from building up your algorithm intuition to exploring different data structures and how they work under the hood. We will also cover topics such as evaluation techniques, function composition and lifting.
